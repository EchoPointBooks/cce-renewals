# Catalog of Copyright Entries Renewals

## Tab-delimited Copyright Renewals, 1950–1991

These files contain, in tab-delimited format, copyright renewals from the US Copyright Office's _Catalog of Copyright Entries_ for the years 1950–1977 (based on [Project Gutenberg transcriptions](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?query=11800) and data from the [Copyright Office's database](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First) for 1978–1991, with a sprinkling of later years (based on [data made available by Google](https://booksearch.blogspot.com/2008/06/us-copyright-renewal-records-available.html)). Renewals from 1950 are not strictly relevant since all books renewed that year are now public domain, but they are included here for completeness.

## Differences from Stanford Copyright Renewals

In 2007 Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources launched a [copyright renewals database](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals) covering the same material. While [transcribing and parsing the original book registration entries](https://github.com/NYPL/catalog_of_copyright_entries_project) (CCE Project) at NYPL we have worked extensively with this data, and decided another version would be useful for two reasons:

1. Stanford's data includes only "Book" or "Class A" registrations. In our CCE project we are transcribing the Book volumes (Part 1, Group 1, 1923–1946; Part 1A, 1947–1953; Part 1, 1953–1964) which include some non-book registrations (about 2% of registration entries). If any of these have renewals, they would be exculded from the Stanford data, but possibly included in the Project Gutenberg transcriptions.

2. Handling of registration numbers and dates. Every registration has a registration number. These numbers are not unique, since the numbering starts over with the end of the "new series" volumes and begining of the "3rd series" in 1947. Therefore registrations need to be referenced by registration number _and_ date. For instance, `A100018` is not unique, we need to distinguish between `A100018/1936-09-15` and `A100018/1953-07-03.` In addition, books published outside the US often have an "interim" (class AI) or foreign (class AF) registration, followed by a regular, class A, registration. Both these registrations may be referenced in the renewal as they are, for instance, in the renewal `R201484`: ``© 10Apr30, AI-13947; 22Aug30, A27120.` In these cases Stanford's data may only record the interim date with the regular registration number, that is `A27120/1930-04-10` which doesn't match either of our CCE project records `AI13947/1930-04-10` (where the date matches the renewal) or `A27120/1930-08-22` (where the number matches).
